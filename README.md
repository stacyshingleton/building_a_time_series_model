# Building a Time Series Model from Climate Data




## Objectives

Create a time series model using weather data from Jena, Germany that will allow the user to predict future weather trends. Such predictions could have a major impact on natural disasters, agricultural yield, renewable energy, or even global warming.  



## The Data

Collected from [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/kusuri/jena-climate), the dataset contains eight years of weather data recorded from the Weather Station at the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry in Jena, Germany. The data contains weather data such as air pressure, air temperature, wind velocity, etc. The raw dataset has 420K+ values, with 15 columns.
